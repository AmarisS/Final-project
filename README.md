# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

### Random Variables:
* The number of passengers come to the airport during a certain date and time.
* Which terminal(international or domestic) each passenger goes to.
* The check-in time for each passenger
### Hypothesis before running the simulation:

* International terminal: 1
* Domestic terminal: 3
* Check-in counter in each terminal: 5

1. The average wait time of the international airport terminal would greater than the average wait time of the domestic airport terminal.
2. The average wait time during the weekend would be greater than the average wait time during the weekdays.
3. Average wait time of check-in would be between 10 and 15 minutes. 
4. the average wait time before holiday would be greater than the average wait time during or after holiday.
### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Instructions on how to use the program:
After running this program, users would need to input their date and time of when they would arrive the airport.
